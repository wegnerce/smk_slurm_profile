# smk_slurm_profile
This is my current [`Snakemake`](https://snakemake.github.io/) profile that I use with the HPC infrastructure of Friedrich Schiller University Jena, which relies on [`SLURM`](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html)

I shamelessly copy&pasted the profile from [Michael Roachs' blog post](https://fame.flinders.edu.au/blog/2021/08/02/snakemake-profiles-updated). 

While reading about `Snakemake` profiles I found the following links particularly useful:

`Snakemake` profiles are available from the [Snakemake-profiles project](https://github.com/Snakemake-Profiles/doc). The `SLURM`profile is maintained by [@percyfal](https://github.com/percyfal) and makes use of [`cookiecutter`](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter).
